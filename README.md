# Rotated_MNIST
Rotated MNIST data and a shallow CNN achieves 99.48 % accuracy in less than 1 hour, using a core-i7 CPU machine (no GPU)!
The result is as good as this google paper but the model is much simpler.

You can run the test.py to test the saved model

For testing you just need keras; for training openCV (cv2), imutils and keras are required
